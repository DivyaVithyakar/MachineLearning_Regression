# 📊 Machine Learning Regression 

**Machine Learning Regression** repository! 🚀 This project demonstrates how to implement **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** and, in the future, will include **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** using Python and `scikit-learn`.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains hands-on implementations of regression models to predict values based on given features.  
- **SLR (Simple Linear Regression)** → Predicting salary based on years of experience.  
- **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) (Coming Soon!)** → !!!
