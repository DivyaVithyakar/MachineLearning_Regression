# 📊 Machine Learning Regression 


Welcome to the **Machine Learning Regression** repository! This repository contains various implementations of machine learning regression models along with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and Boosting Algorithms. The goal is to provide centralized setup and multiple regression models with hyperparameter optimization techniques using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📊 Models Implemented

- **GridSearchCV**: Hyperparameter tuning is implemented for various regression models (e.g., AdaBoost, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Boosting Algorithms**: Implements boosting techniques like AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
- **Centralized Setup**: Datasets are managed centrally for ease of use and reusability across different models.
- **Multiple Regression Models**: Includes various models like Linear Regression (Simple and Multiple), Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVR, etc.
