# 📊 Machine Learning Regression 

**Machine Learning Regression** repository! 🚀 This project demonstrates how to implement **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** and, in the future, will include **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** using Python and `scikit-learn`.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains hands-on implementations of regression models to predict values based on given features.  
- **SLR (Simple Linear Regression)** → Predicting salary based on years of experience.  
- **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) (Coming Soon!)** → Predicting profit based on multiple features such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.

📊 Models Implemented
1. Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
Objective: Predict salary based on years of experience using Simple Linear Regression.
Dataset: A CSV file with YearsExperience and Salary.
Evaluation Metric: R² Score (Goodness of fit for the model).
Model Storage: Pickle is used to save and load the trained model.
2. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
Objective: Predict profit based on multiple features such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and categorical features like State using Multiple Linear Regression.
Dataset: A CSV file with features like R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State, along with the Profit as the target.
Evaluation Metric: R² Score (Goodness of fit for the model).
Model Storage: Pickle is used to save and load the trained model.

📊 Model Evaluation
- Metric Used: R² Score (Goodness of fit for the model)
- Model Storage: pickle for saving and loading trained models.

Notes:
SLR is focused on predicting salary based on years of experience, while MLR can handle multiple predictors and is used for predicting profit using more complex datasets.
This repository will continue to expand with new implementations and improvements.
